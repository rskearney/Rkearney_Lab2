# Visualizing NDVI in Poland

For this assignment, I chose to visualize NDVI in Poland as a GIF. The reason why I chose Poland is because my family is from there and I am also a Polish citizen. Poland is the second largest country in central Europe behind Germany. The country got its name from the Western-Slavic tribe called the "Polens" who settled in the area. The tribe's name is usually attributed to the proto-slavic word "pol'e" which meant "open area, plains, or fields." Thus, the tribe was known as the "People of the Fields." (Gliński 2015) The people, land, and agricultural practices that made this land unique also contributed to its rise as a regional power. Eventually, the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth would be the largest country in Europe by land area. This nation's rise and the valuable territory it controlled also made it the target of its many powerful neighbors. The wars over the territory resulted in the country being wiped off the map three different times throughout history. Despite these setbacks, the people, the country, and the agricultural practices that became synonimous with Poland persist to this day.

Based on this visualization it possible to identify the seasonal patterns that occur in Poland. The winter is categorized by very low NDVI values as much of the county is covered with snow during the winter. This is especially apparent in the northeast of the country near the border with Lithuania and in the south where the Carpathian Mountains are located along the borders of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The warming temperatures associated with the spring melt the snowcover and a sharp increase in NDVI can be observed. The increasing NDVI peaks in the summer months and begins to taper into the fall. In some areas, a dramatic reduction in NDVI occurs in the fall which can be associated with the harvesting of crops. The areas that do not experience this sharp decrease can be considered more permenant/natural vegetation such as forests or shrubland.
